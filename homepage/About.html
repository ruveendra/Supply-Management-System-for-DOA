    <p>"The service was impeccable, which is not always the case in Sri Lanka, so I felt immediately comfortable and relaxed. The room was clean, with everything we needed, including lovely toiletries from Ceylon Spa, and had an amazing view of Greenish Paddy fields. We enjoyed a very fun night, had food and drinks and a relaxing Good night sleep. This was overall a wonderful heaven in Sri Lanka, and a place I would love to return to."</p>
